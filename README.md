# 12V-to-220V-Step-Up-Inverter-using-transformer-in-Proteus
simulation of 12V to 220V Step Up Inverter using transformer 
In this project, a 12V power is fed into the circuit. This power is then amplified to 220V with the help of tramsformer and other components and we get the 220V at the output. The circuit has many application in practical life. You can find other serviceable projects on www.theengineeringprojects.com .
